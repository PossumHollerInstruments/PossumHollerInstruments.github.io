<div class="about">
	This website is for IT270. It is built from scratch. The idea of this website is to create a prototype for a music shop based on the name that my Uncle came up with, which is based on the Greek symbol Phi. I wanted it to be simple, easy to navigate, and logical. I plan to do a lot more with it, like adding details and descriptions to the products, resizing the pictures, adding more CSS, adding some Javascript. I think this is satisfactory for now and meets all the requirements in the rubric. I chose the Lobster font because it is pleasing on the eyes and readable.
